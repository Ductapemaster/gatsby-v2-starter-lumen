description: "A new experiment: blogging"

With the COVID-19 quarantine continuing into the forseeable future, I have taken
a lot of time to think about things to start doing that I've always said I was
going to do.  This blog is one of them!

This will be a bit of an experiment — I'm going to see how I like writing more
often and if a singular focus for this space arises out of the process, or if I 
like sticking to writing about whatever I'm working on at the moment.

There will definitely be some recipe reports from what I am cooking up (something
I have always loved, but have been doing a lot more of while confined to the
apartment).  Probably some more content about what I happen to be soldering,
either for work or just for fun.  Maybe some posts about places I travel, or
things I take photos of on land or underwater.  If we really get into it, there
might even me some _music_!

So, here's to new beginnings and journeys born out of the unexpected.
